The Simon Says Game is a modern web-based memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The objective is simple: observe the color pattern displayed by the system and repeat it correctly. With every successful round, the pattern grows longer, increasing the difficulty and improving the player’s focus, memory, and reaction time.

This project demonstrates strong front-end fundamentals, event handling, game logic, and clean UI design.
